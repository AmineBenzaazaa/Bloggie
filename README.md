<h1>Running Front-end</h1>
<p>This guide will walk you through the steps to run a React project using the `package.json` file provided. We assume that you have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the following link:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cloning the Project</h2>
<p>First, clone the React project repository from your preferred version control system (e.g., GitHub) or copy the project folder to your local machine.</p>
<h2>Installing Dependencies</h2>
<p>Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project root directory and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
<p>This command installs all the project dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.</p>
<h2>Running the Project</h2>
<p>After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the development server:</p>
<pre><code>npm run dev</code></pre>
<p>This will start the development server and open a new browser window with your React application running. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.</p>
<h2>Building the Project</h2>
<p>When you're ready to deploy your application to a production environment, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npm run build</code></pre>
<p>This command builds the application for production and generates a `build` directory containing the optimized production build of your application. You can then deploy this directory to your web server.</p>
<h2>Previewing the Production Build</h2>
<p>You can preview the production build of your application by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npm run preview</code></pre>
<p>This will start a local server serving the production build of your application.</p>
<p>That's it! You should now be able to run and build your React project using the `package.json` file provided.</p>
